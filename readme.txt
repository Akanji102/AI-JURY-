⚖️ AI Jury — When Machines Learn to Judge

AI Jury is not just a model.
It’s a concept: What happens when artificial intelligence sits in a courtroom, listens to facts, and delivers a verdict?

Built at the crossroads of law and machine learning, AI Jury explores how reasoning, bias, and justice can be simulated — and one day, maybe improved — through artificial intelligence.

🧠 The Vision

Every day, thousands of cases are decided by human judges and juries — influenced by experience, interpretation, and sometimes, emotion.

But what if justice could be analyzed mathematically?
What if data could help us understand — not replace — human judgment?

AI Jury is my experimental attempt to do exactly that:
A system that predicts legal case outcomes based on facts, context, and precedent — and provides a window into how machines “think” about justice.

⚙️ How It Works

You present the case facts — just as you would to a real court.

The AI deliberates, analyzing the linguistic patterns, argument strength, and key terms.

The verdict is rendered: Who wins? What’s the likely disposition of the court?

Explanation follows — a textual summary that mirrors judicial reasoning.

It’s an algorithmic jury — trained not to replace judgment, but to study it.
